## Inside

This is meant to be a repository containing all relevant class code, including:
- **Lectures:** content we cover in class, in a runnable format, including worked examples (for e.g., rock paper scissors)
- **Labs:** content we assign in class, this is marked for completion only. We will include both starter files here, as well as solutions (past deadline)
- **Assignments:** content we assign in class, this is marked for correctness. We will include both starter files here, as well as solutions (past deadline)

## Schedule

Class time is for learning new material and live coding demos by your instructors. Questions related to the material covered in class (or previous classes) are highly encouraged. Most of the material will build off of prior material, and it is very important to have the foundations to understand future concepts. If you miss a lecture, please make sure to watch the recording as soon as possible so that you are not missing context in the next class.

Lab time is for working on your assignments and group projects. Your teams will be assigned later this week, and your participation in your team is expected. You are each other's team throughout the course to learn and grow together!

We **highly** recommend using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) as a learning tool, especially for programming. Here's a [reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPopzUreo4I&list=PLpYu7Wkyi5ruXL-HBsw61NmqZy2yLEqXc&index=31) showcasing great examples of its usage. It's like having a friendly and helpful tutor available 24/7. Whether you're just starting out or already know some programming, ChatGPT can assist you. It knows a lot about different programming languages and can explain things in simple terms. If you're stuck on a coding problem, ChatGPT can provide quick explanations and help you think through it. It's like having a programming buddy to learn from.
