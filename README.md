Class time is for learning new material and live coding demos by your instructors. Questions related to the material covered in class (or previous classes) are highly encouraged. Most of the material will build off of prior material, and it is very important to have the foundations to understand future concepts. If you miss a lecture, please make sure to watch the recording as soon as possible so that you are not missing context in the next class.

Lab time is for working on your assignments and group projects. Your teams will be assigned later this week, and your participation in your team is expected. You are each other's team throughout the course to learn and grow together!
