// Lab 1.1: 
// For each of these, please write your code on the successive line we have provided
// Declare a variable for your first name

// Declare a variable for your last name

// Declare a variable for your age

// Declare a variable for whether you like ice cream or not

// Declare a variable for your favorite color

// Declare a variable for your full name and assign it by concatenating your first and last name. Make sure to use your variables!

// Log this sentence, replacing the bold parts with the values stored in your variables: 
// “I am fullname, and I am age years old, and I preference ice cream that is favouritecolour”
console.log("...");

// Edit the code and try to produce at least 5 different error messages. What do these messages say? Copy them into your file as comments.
// 






// Lab 1.2:
// Write the statements below equivalently in code using console logs
// For example "Three is greater than 1" --> console.log(3 > 1); for some of them, you may need to declare new variables, and assign values
// "Five is less than two"

// "Twelve is not equivalent to one hundred"

// "Apples are red or green"

// "Cats are cute and not quiet"


// Lab 2.1 & 2.2:
// Use variables to write the code equivalents of the following expressions and log whether the statement is true or false:
// "Three is not bigger than thirty-three"

// "Twenty-four divided by six is four"

// "Eight is larger than seven and smaller than ten"

// "'Coding' comes before 'Programming' (in the alphabet) and 2023 comes before 2024 (in numbers)"


// Use comments to write out the evaluation steps for the following script:
let num1 = 2023;
let num2 = 2024;
let str1 = "Coding";
let str2 = "Programming";
let result1 = !(str1 > str2) && num1 < num2;
let result2 = !(str1 > str2 && num1 < num2);

// Are result1 and result2 the same? Explain your answer in comments.
