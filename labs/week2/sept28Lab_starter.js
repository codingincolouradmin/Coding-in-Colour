/**
 * Lab 1.1
 * Create a program that simulates an ATM Machine. It will print out the total amount of money in the account. The account starts of with a balance of $100.
 * The program should:
 *      Ask the user how much money they want to deposit or withdraw
 *      The user provides a positive number if they want to deposit, negative number if they want to withdraw
 *      Use the user's input to update the balance
 *      Print the total amount

let bankBalance1 = 100; // Starting bank balance



/**
 * Lab 1.2
 * 1. Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of numbers from 1 to 10:
 *      Write the pseudocode first to make this a lot easier. What does the program need to do at each step?
 *      Hint 1: the variable containing the sum exists outside of the loop
 *      Hint 2: the sum of numbers from 1 to 3 is 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)
 * 
 * 2. Write a program that generates and displays the following number pattern to the console
 *      1
 *      1 2
 *      1 2 3
 *      1 2 3 4
 *      1 2 3 4 5
 *      Hint: think about using a string instead of a number to store your "sum"

/**
 * Lab 2.1
 * Use your ATM machine code that you made for lab this morning. Keep your old code and write a new code for an ATM machine that keeps asking the user
 * how much money they want to deposit or withdraw (positive number is deposit, negative number is withdraw). The ATM adjusts the total balance in the account
 * according to the user's input, and keeps asking until the user enters "0"

/**
 * Lab 2.2 
 * Use everything you have learned so far to recreate the number guesser project that you have seen the instructors create. Make sure you do this yourself!
 *      It is more important to us that you learn how to do it, rather than to "get it right on the first try"
 *      If the guess is within 10 of the actual number, tell them they're "Warm", and if its more than 10 away from the actual number, tell them they're "Cold"
