// Lab 1
// Think about this morning. You decided to wake up and come to class, perhaps deciding what to eat for breakfast
// Make a list of 6 decisions that you make everyday and write thme down in if-else format
// For each of these, then please convert your examples into code that uses variables to hold onto the condition 

/**
 * Example 
 * If it's early, I will make coffee, otherwise, I will just drink plain water
 */

let early = true
if (early) {
    console.log("I will make coffee");
} else {
    console.log("I will drink plain water");
}

// Lab 2
// Use the example shown in class to create your own number guesser! (We've included comments to help get you started)
const prompt = require('prompt-sync')(); // We've setup the import for you

// TODO: Get a random number between 1 and 10
let randomNumber;

// TODO: Get the user's input
let userGuess; 

// TODO: Perform a comparison, and then handle conditional logic based on the output
/**
 * if (comparison) {
 *     // True case -> tell the user this
 * } else {
 *     // False case -> What should we do?
 *     // A couple things can happen here -> Check for Invalid input (what does this mean?)
 *     //                                 -> Check for the userGuess being greater than the randomNumber
 *     //                                 -> Check for the userGuess being smaller than the randomNumber
 * }

// The example I provided above is an if-else logic, you can also chain if-else statements like below
// Just ensure that your logic is sound
/**
 * if (condition1) {
 * } else if (condition2) {
 * } else if (condition3) {
 * } else ...
