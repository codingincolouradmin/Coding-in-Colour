 * 4. Add a short story or note to each of the text files using the `echo` command.
 * 5. Display the content of each file using `cat`.
 * 6. Make a directory inside `GitJourney` called `backup`. Move `notes.txt` into the `backup` directory.

/**
 * Lab 1.2: Github Practice
 * 
 * 1. Set up SSH for GitHub as discussed in the lecture.
 * 2. Create a new repository on GitHub named `MyGitExperience`.
 * 3. Clone the repository on your local machine.
 * 4. Add the files from `GitJourney` into this local repo. Commit and push the changes.
 * 5. Create a new branch called `feature-story`. Switch to this branch.
 * 6. Modify the `myStory.txt` to add more details or a twist in the tale. Commit and push this to the `feature-story` branch.
 * 7. Modify the `journey.txt` to add some more details. Commit and push this to the `feature-story` branch
 * 8. Use `git diff` to see differences between branches.
 * 9. In your `MyGitExperience` repo, use `git log` to view your commit history.
 * 10. Detach your HEAD and navigate to an earlier commit.
 * 11. Return to the latest commit.
 * 12. Try out `git revert` to return to a previous version of your files (go back so that journey is not modified).
 * 13. Create a pull request on GitHub to merge `feature-story` into `master`. Write a short description explaining your changes.
 * 14. Merge the pull request.
 * 15. Create a new issue to keep note of a change you want to make to one of your files
 * 16. Assign the issue to yourself
 * 17. Resolve the issue by adding the change and then close it with a comment
 * 18. Make sure to pull the changes from origin into your local repo
