// With the current values and operation, it should output: "The result of 5 add 3 = 8"
// Please find all the bugs and correct them, also adding comments where you found the bugs

// Q2. Convert the following if-else chain to a switch statement, while still maintaining the correct output.

let title = "Die Hard";

  genre = "Science Fiction";
} else if (title === "The Shawshank Redemption") {

} else if (title === "Die Hard") {
  genre = "Action";
} else {
  genre = "Unknown Genre";
}

console.log(`The genre of "${title}" is ${genre}.`);

// Write your code below this line -->


// Q3. Convert the following if-else statements to a ternary operator
// Exercise #1:
let number = 7;
let type;

if (number % 2 === 0) {
  type = "Even";
} else {
  type = "Odd";
}

console.log(`The number ${number} is ${type}.`);
// Write your code below this line -->


// Exercise #2:
let grade = 58;
let outcome;

if (grade >= 60) {
  outcome = "Passing";
} else {
  outcome = "Failing";
}

console.log(`With a grade of ${grade}, the outcome is: ${outcome}.`);
// Write your code below this line -->


// Exercise #3:
let temperature = 18; // Celsius
let weather;

if (temperature > 20) {
  weather = "Hot";
} else {
  weather = "Cold";
}

console.log(`With a temperature of ${temperature}Â°C, it's ${weather}.`);

 * Question 11:
 * Description:
 *      You are now accepting ticket purchases, and need to put an "X" in the seats that are purchased. 
 *      Seats are booked using user input for which row and seat number they want (e.g., row 3, seat 3).
 *      They will be asked for the row number and seat number separately. If a seat is already booked, the user should be asked to try again. 
 *      Otherwise, a new 'X' will be placed in the chosen seat.
