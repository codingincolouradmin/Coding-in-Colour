Description:
Today, you will be creating your own game, a simplified version of Blackjack. The game rules are as follows:

1. The computer will start with a random number between 1 and 5.
2. The user will be asked for a number between 1 and 5.
3. The computer will add the user's number to its random number.
4. It will check if the total value is 21.

These steps will keep repeating until the total is 21 or above.
